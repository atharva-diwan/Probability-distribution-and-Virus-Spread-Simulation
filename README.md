# Probability-distribution-and-Virus-Spread-Simulation
# 1.Probability Distribution:
The code simulates rolling 3 dice 1000 times and plots Probability Distribution Curve for Sum of the numbers on 3 dice.
# 2.Virus Spread Simulation:
The code depicts a very basic Virus spread simulation in a rectangular large area with 0s turning into 1 depiicting a person getting infected with virus. Random shuffling means travelling.The flow of simulation is listed below:\
1.A two dimensional matrix (size:100x150) as a rectangular area\
2.Swapping 8 random entries within the matrix to depict travelling\
3.infection probability of first neighbors and second neighbors set 0.25 and 0.08 respectively\
4.Process iterated until each entry is infected(becomes one) and 2 plots drawn to infer the spread\
5.Plot 1: Number of ones in the matrix vs Number of iterations\
6.Plot 2: Change in number of ones in each iteration vs Number of iterations
